# Current Status

## Phase 1 Complete

The current implementation stage connects a configurable answer policy to the traceable QA workflow.

Completed in this phase:

- Added shared AnswerPolicy abstractions under `docagent/models/`.
- Added Qwen answer policy wrapper for `base`, `sft`, and `grpo` modes.
- Added shared workflow prompt builder and structured output parser.
- Updated `run_qa_workflow` to require an explicit answer policy instead of silently using `heuristic_answer`.
- Added bounded repair routing after format/location checks.
- Added run-level SQLite trace persistence through `TraceRepository`.
- Added CLI smoke/eval/trace inspection scripts for workflow-level testing.
- Aligned workflow Qwen generation default with the standalone checkpoint eval `MAX_NEW_TOKENS=1024` setting to avoid truncating valid JSON outputs.
- Verified Base/SFT/GRPO policy switching through the same workflow CLI.

Validation on AutoDL:

| Mode | Samples | Workflow Success | Raw JSON | Schema | Answer EM | Answer F1 | Location | Trace Persist |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| base | 10 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.50 | 0.5562 | 0.90 | 1.0 |
| sft | 50 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.58 | 0.6715 | 0.92 | 1.0 |
| grpo | 50 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.56 | 0.6769 | 0.94 | 1.0 |

The GRPO workflow run also passed SQLite trace inspection. A persisted run can be replayed through `scripts/inspect_workflow_trace.py`, with ordered nodes for `retrieve_evidence`, `generate_answer`, `check_format`, `check_location`, and `finalize`.

Current boundary:

- No new SFT/GRPO training.
- No reward changes.
- No data split changes.
- No Dense Retriever, Reranker, MinerU, TAT-QA, InfographicVQA, VLM, API, or Demo expansion in this phase.

Known limitation:

- Remaining low-answer examples are mostly reader extraction errors inside the correct OCR block, such as neighboring entities, abbreviation expansion ambiguity, or numeric row selection. This matches the earlier SFT/GRPO reader error analysis and is not a workflow integration failure.
