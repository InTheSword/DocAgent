# Active Plan

> Stable entry point for the current Codex task. Detailed phase history stays in
> the phase-specific plan files linked below.

## Current Stage

```text
Phase 4D-A.4: Candidate span / normalization gap final review
```

## Current Goal

```text
Phase 4C candidate_evidence.jsonl
-> deterministic typed candidate answer extraction
-> candidate answer board artifacts
-> coverage / rank / distractor metrics
-> error bucket analysis
-> extraction/ranking refinement before Candidate-ID Reader
-> filtering / reranking / type-aware top-k board before Candidate-ID Reader
-> C/D/E case-level failure inspection before new Reader work
-> refined action attribution from final-answer hit and candidate/top-k coverage
-> final subtype split for candidate_span_or_normalization_gap before any repair
```

Phase 3 is historical and frozen. Phase 4A is accepted. Do not rewrite Phase 3
evaluation implementation, metrics, or conclusions in this phase.

## Allowed Scope

- preserve the accepted 26-window / 90-QA Gate 4 expanded regression;
- do not expand to all 29 shards in Phase 4B;
- prioritize the accepted server sample and ingestion assets;
- keep generated assets under ignored `outputs/`.
- implement deterministic candidate answer extraction and audit artifacts from
  existing Phase 4C candidate_spans outputs.
- use QA gold answers only for coverage metrics and error buckets, not for
  candidate answer extraction or candidate answer artifacts.
- refine candidate answer extraction, ranking, top-k metrics, and limited
  top-k board artifacts without using Reader or AnswerPolicy.
- filter and rerank candidate answers for type-aware top-k boards while
  preserving all candidates for audit coverage.
- export case-level C/D/E failure inspection artifacts for audit and targeted
  planning only. Inspection artifacts may include gold answers for debugging,
  but they must not be used as Reader input.
- refine inspection summary attribution by combining candidate bucket, final
  answer hit, candidate-answer coverage, and top-k coverage.
- split `candidate_span_or_normalization_gap` into final diagnostic subtypes
  for audit and decision guidance only.

## Blockers

- No blocker for the accepted Phase 4A foundation.
- Gate 3 real-model E2E and Gate 3A default prompt rollback are accepted for
  the small 3-window regression.
- Gate 4 expanded raw-input regression is accepted; it is not a formal
  benchmark and does not change the default AnswerPolicy prompt/context.
- Phase 4D-A server coverage audit is accepted. Its result shows that the next
  blocker is candidate answer extraction/ranking quality, not a Reader change.
- Phase 4D-A.1 server refined audit is accepted. It improved coverage but
  increased candidate noise, so Candidate-ID Reader remains deferred.
- Phase 4D-A.2 server filtering audit is accepted. It cleaned the top-k board
  but did not improve all coverage or C/D/E buckets enough to enter
  Candidate-ID Reader.
- Phase 4D-A.3 server inspection is accepted. It showed that C/D/E buckets mix
  candidate-layer gaps and final-answer failures.
- Phase 4D-A.3.1 server refined inspection is accepted. Its largest refined
  failure source is `candidate_span_or_normalization_gap = 21`, which is still
  too coarse for a repair decision.
- Phase 4D-A.4 local implementation has no local blocker. The final gap review
  server run requires server-side A.3.1 refined artifacts, which may be absent
  from the local ignored `outputs/` tree.

Gate 4 accepted server scope:

```text

source_shards = MP-DocVQA val shards 1-4
```

Gate 4C retrieval-only:

```text
run = outputs/evaluation/phase4b_mpdocvqa_gate4/gate4c_retrieval_only_empty_page_fix
fixed_evidence_hash = 723160441137a42a3cf3b7775f94ffd6dd681cb15ac67bc2c5d2d0bfdc9feab3
BM25 Recall@1/3/5 = 0.6111 / 0.8667 / 0.9111
BM25 MRR = 0.7259
Hybrid Recall@1/3/5 = 0.7333 / 0.9222 / 0.9556
Hybrid MRR = 0.8257
retrieval_gold_miss_top5 = 4
```

Gate 4D full GRPO E2E:

```text
run = outputs/evaluation/phase4b_mpdocvqa_gate4/gate4_full_grpo
completed_count = 90
failed_count = 0
normalized_exact_match = 0.3333

trace_counts.qa_runs = 90
trace_counts.tool_traces = 613
failure_taxonomy = answer_miss:59, gold_page_location_miss:46, retrieval_gold_miss_top5:4
```

Interpretation boundary:

- Gate 4 is an expanded raw-input integration regression, not a formal
  benchmark.
- The flow is stable through ingestion, page retrieval, fixed evidence,
  AnswerPolicy JSON/format validation, and SQLite trace persistence.
- Hybrid retrieval is usable over the expanded sample (`Top-5 recall=0.9556`).
- Main remaining issues are Reader `answer_miss` and `gold_page_location_miss`.
- `--rank-aware-context` remains diagnostic only; default is false.

Phase 4C accepted server A/B:

```text
baseline_run = outputs/evaluation/phase4b_mpdocvqa_gate4/gate4_full_grpo
candidate_retrieval_only_run = outputs/evaluation/phase4c_candidate_spans/gate4_candidate_spans_retrieval_only
candidate_full_grpo_run = outputs/evaluation/phase4c_candidate_spans/gate4_candidate_spans_full_grpo

```

Phase 4C compact result:

```text
candidate_spans normalized_exact_match = 0.4111 (+0.0778)
candidate_spans answer_hit = 0.4556 (+0.1111)
candidate_spans token_f1 = 0.4628 (+0.0939)
candidate_spans character_f1 = 0.6341 (+0.1106)
candidate_spans gold_page_location_hit = 0.6778 (+0.1889)
candidate_spans block_location_hit = 1.0 (+0.0333)
answer_miss = 49 (-10)
gold_page_location_miss = 29 (-17)
retrieval_gold_miss_top5 = 4 (unchanged)
```

Phase 4C interpretation:

- Hybrid retrieval metrics are unchanged from the Phase 4B Gate 4 baseline:
  Hybrid Recall@1/3/5 = 0.7333 / 0.9222 / 0.9556 and MRR = 0.8257.
- The improvement comes from query-aware / structure-aware evidence packing,
  not from retrieval model changes, AnswerPolicy prompt changes, or retraining.
- `candidate_spans` reduced mean selected block count from 39.8444 to 15.3333
  while preserving `gold_page_has_candidate_span_rate = 0.9556`.
- `candidate_spans` is accepted as an experimental and recommended evidence
  packing mode, but it is not yet the global default.
- Full details are recorded in `docs/PHASE4C_CANDIDATE_SPANS_REPORT.md`.

Phase 4D-A accepted server audit:

```text

candidate_answer_coverage = 0.4556
mean_candidate_answer_count = 79.5889

bucket_E_gold_answer_in_candidate_answers_but_model_answer_wrong = 13
bucket_F_gold_answer_in_candidate_answers_and_model_answer_correct = 26
```

Phase 4D-A interpretation:

- Do not enter Candidate-ID Grounded Reader directly from this result.
- The immediate bottleneck is candidate answer extraction / normalization /
  ranking noise: 25 samples have the gold answer in candidate spans but not in
  extracted candidate answers, and average candidate answer count is 79.5889.
- 22 samples still require candidate span improvement.
- 13 answer-covered samples require later Reader or candidate-selection work.

Phase 4D-A.1 accepted server audit:

```text
sample_count = 90
candidate_span_answer_coverage = 0.7444
candidate_answer_coverage = 0.5222
candidate_answer_coverage_all = 0.5222

bucket_C = 22
bucket_D = 21
bucket_E = 14
bucket_F = 29
bucket_G = 0
candidate_answer_no_gold_leakage = true
```

Phase 4D-A.1 interpretation:

- Extraction refinement improved `candidate_answer_coverage` from 0.4556 to
  0.5222, reduced `D` from 25 to 21, increased `F` from 26 to 29, and improved
  `rank_1` from 10 to 20.
- Candidate noise also increased: mean candidate answer count rose from 79.5889
  to 105.2889 and mean numeric distractor count rose from 60.4444 to 73.7444.
- Do not enter Candidate-ID Grounded Reader yet; optimize filtering, reranking,
  and type-aware top-k boards first.

Phase 4D-A.2 accepted server audit:

```text
sample_count = 90
candidate_span_answer_coverage = 0.7444
candidate_answer_coverage_all = 0.5222
candidate_answer_coverage_top1 = 0.2333
candidate_answer_coverage_top3 = 0.3111
candidate_answer_coverage_top5 = 0.3889
candidate_answer_coverage_top10 = 0.4333
candidate_answer_coverage_top20 = 0.4556
mean_candidate_answer_count = 105.2889
mean_unique_candidate_answer_count = 52.2333
mean_ranked_candidate_answer_count = 68.9222
mean_top20_candidate_answer_count = 13.6111
mean_topk_numeric_candidate_count = 5.3111
topk_retention_ratio = 0.1293
topk_numeric_ratio = 0.3902
bucket_A = 4
bucket_B = 0
bucket_C = 22
bucket_D = 21
bucket_E = 14
bucket_F = 29
bucket_G = 0
```

Phase 4D-A.2 interpretation:

- Filtering/reranking made the top-k board cleaner and slightly improved
  top1/top5 coverage: `top1=0.2333`, `top5=0.3889`.
- Top20 coverage dropped from 0.5000 to 0.4556, while all coverage stayed at
  0.5222 and C/D/E buckets did not improve.
- Do not enter Candidate-ID Grounded Reader yet. The next step is C/D/E
  case-level failure inspection to identify targeted candidate span,
  extraction, normalization, ranking, or Reader work.

Phase 4D-A.3 accepted server inspection:

```text
artifacts = failure_inspection_cases.jsonl,
            bucket_C_cases.jsonl,
            bucket_D_cases.jsonl,
            bucket_E_cases.jsonl,
            failure_inspection_summary.json,
            failure_inspection_summary.md
```

Phase 4D-A.3 inspection interpretation:

- C/D/E buckets are candidate-layer diagnostics, not equivalent to final QA
  failures.
- Some C/D samples have `phase4c_prediction.answer_hit = true` and should not
  be counted as primary repair targets.
- True next-action attribution must combine bucket, final answer hit,
  candidate-answer coverage, and top-k coverage.
- Phase 4D-A.3.1 refines the summary/action attribution while still avoiding
  Reader prompt, AnswerPolicy, training, CDC, and Demo changes.

Phase 4D-A.3.1 accepted server refined inspection:

```text
candidate_span_or_normalization_gap = 21
extraction_rule_gap = 10
no_final_failure = 11
normalization_or_metric_gap = 5
reader_selection_gap = 7
topk_filtering_gap = 3
inspect_candidate_spans_or_normalization = 21
improve_candidate_answer_extraction = 10
candidate_id_reader_or_deterministic_selection = 7
improve_type_aware_topk_filtering = 3
inspect_answer_normalization = 5
no_action_final_answer_already_correct = 11
```

Phase 4D-A.4 implemented boundary:

- filter A.3.1 refined cases where
  `refined_failure_source = candidate_span_or_normalization_gap`;
- export `candidate_span_gap_cases.jsonl`,
  `candidate_span_gap_preview.json`, `candidate_span_gap_summary.json`, and
  `candidate_span_gap_summary.md`;
- assign only the allowed final subtypes:
  `normalization_or_metric_gap`, `candidate_span_selection_gap`,
  `candidate_span_partial_context_gap`, `table_or_index_span_gap`,
  `page_number_or_content_lookup_gap`, `ocr_or_parsing_gap`, and
  `unclear_mixed_gap`;
- keep every case marked `should_not_patch_specific_qid = true`.

Phase 4D-A.4 decision boundary:

- No per-qid, per-document, or answer-specific repair is allowed.
- After A.4, implement one narrow generic fix only if one subtype dominates
  and has a generic repair path.
- If subtypes are dispersed, stop tuning this 90-sample probe and run the same
  diagnostics on a larger unseen validation sample.
- Candidate-ID Reader remains postponed unless reader-selection gaps become
  dominant after candidate coverage issues are resolved.

## Local Validation

Local `main` validation covers code and documentation state. The accepted Gate
4 artifacts are server-side outputs; the local absence of these ignored paths
does not indicate missing tracked code:

```text
outputs/phase4/mpdocvqa_raw_gate4_expanded
outputs/phase4/mpdocvqa_ingestion
outputs/evaluation/phase4b_mpdocvqa_gate4/
```

Phase 4A server acceptance is now recorded from real execution:

document_window_count = 5
qa_count = 12
absolute_path_hit_count = 0
```

## Next Priorities

1. Run Phase 4D-A.4 candidate span / normalization gap final review on the
   server A.3.1 refined inspection run directory.
2. Review subtype counts. If one subtype dominates and has a generic repair
   path, implement one narrow generic fix; otherwise stop tuning this
   90-sample probe and expand validation coverage.
3. Keep `page_children` as the default until more shard and document-type
   validation supports a global default change.
4. Keep CDC `not_started` until explicitly started.

## Stop Condition

```text
Phase 4D-A.4 local implementation implemented
+ targeted and regression tests pass
+ status documents updated
+ branch pushed
+ stop before Reader prompt changes, AnswerPolicy integration, training, CDC, Demo,
   per-qid repairs, and any global `candidate_spans` default change
```
